       description: A dry food for medium breed senior dogs between 10-25 kg. High levels of omega-3 from fish to help keep older joints flexible. Lower calories and higher fibre helps avoid weight gain in the less active older dogs. Moderately reduced phosphorus and sodium levels reduce workload on the kidneys and added taurine to support heart muscle function.
       benefits: It is rich in Omega-3 from fish for healthy coat skin and joint. It helps to maintain the ideal bodyweight. With lower calories and higher fibre this is a less energy dense food. This means they can eat their usual amount, so not feel hungry, whilst controlling weight. It also contains L carnitine – a fat burning amino acid. The use of highly digestible proteins such as fish allows them to digest the food even with the less efficient digestive systems of older dogs. Beet pulp as a source of fermentable fibres to support beneficial microflora and intestinal health. Reduced protein, phosphorous and sodium to lower workload on the kidneys. Added Taurine and and L-Carnitine supports the heart muscle function.
