  description: A dry food for small breed senior dogs under 10 kg. High levels of
    omega-3 from fish help keep older joints flexible. Lower calories and higher fiber
    help avoid weight gain in the less active older dogs. Moderately reduced phosphorus
    and sodium levels reduce workload on the kidneys and added taurine supports heart
    muscle function.
  benefits: It is rich in Omega-3 from fish for healthy coat skin and joint. It helps
    to maintain the ideal body weight. With lower calories and higher fiber, this
    is a less energy-dense food. This means they can eat their usual amount, so not
    feel hungry, while controlling weight. It also contains L-carnitine – a fat-burning
    amino acid. The use of highly digestible proteins such as fish allows them to
    digest the food even with the less efficient digestive systems of older dogs.
    Beet pulp as a source of fermentable fibers supports beneficial microflora and
    intestinal health. Reduced protein, phosphorus, and sodium to lower workload on
    the kidneys. Added Taurine and L-Carnitine support the heart muscle function.
