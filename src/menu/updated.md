  description: A wet food pate for puppies with all the vitamins and minerals needed for healthy growth and with high levels of Omega-3 from fish to support development of the eyes, brain, skin, coat and joints. This is a complete wet food so you can feed it either as the main food or mixed with dry kibble as a tasty treat.
  benefits: It has high levels of Omega-3 from fish supporting brain and eye development and development of healthy coat, skin and joints. It contains added beta glucans from yeast to support the immune system. Added psyllium husk absorbs water, firming up stools, and regulating the digestive tract. Please note - because of the special growth sensitivity in large and giant breeds, it is important that they are given Puppy Large and Giant Breed as their main, daily dog food.
