<h1>JAMstack Learning Progress</h1>
<p>Welcome to my JAMstack learning repository! Here, I document my progress as I explore the JAMstack architecture, which combines JavaScript, APIs, and Markup to create simpler, faster, and more secure websites.</p>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm Alleina Abad, and I'm using this repository to document my progress in JAMstack development. I'll be following the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/your-video-link">JAMstack Course - Build websites that are simpler, faster, and more secure</a>
, created by Phil Hawksworth, on the FreeCodeCamp Youtube Channel.</p>
<h2>What is JAMstack?</h2>
<p>JAMstack is an architectural pattern for web development that emphasizes decoupling the front-end and back-end, resulting in highly performant, scalable, and secure websites. It stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup, and its key principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Enables dynamic client-side functionality and enhanced user experiences.</li>
<li><strong>APIs:</strong> Allows for easy integration with external services or custom back-end systems.</li>
<li><strong>Markup:</strong> Utilizes pre-built markup files, such as HTML templates, generated during the build process and served from a content delivery network (CDN).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Repository Purpose</h2>
<p>This repository serves as my personal space to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the JAMstack Course. It contains code samples, exercises, and project templates that I use for hands-on practice and experimentation.</p>
<h2>Resources</h2>
