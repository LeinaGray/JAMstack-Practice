# JAMstack Learning Progress

Welcome to my JAMstack learning repository! Here, I document my progress as I explore the JAMstack architecture, which combines JavaScript, APIs, and Markup to create simpler, faster, and more secure websites.

## About Me

I'm Alleina Abad, and I'm using this repository to document my progress in JAMstack development. I'll be following the [JAMstack Course - Build websites that are simpler, faster, and more secure](https://www.youtube.com/your-video-link)
, created by Phil Hawksworth, on the FreeCodeCamp Youtube Channel. 

## What is JAMstack?

JAMstack is an architectural pattern for web development that emphasizes decoupling the front-end and back-end, resulting in highly performant, scalable, and secure websites. It stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup, and its key principles are:

- **JavaScript:** Enables dynamic client-side functionality and enhanced user experiences.
- **APIs:** Allows for easy integration with external services or custom back-end systems.
- **Markup:** Utilizes pre-built markup files, such as HTML templates, generated during the build process and served from a content delivery network (CDN).

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as my personal space to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the JAMstack Course. It contains code samples, exercises, and project templates that I use for hands-on practice and experimentation.

## Resources

These are the resources I used in order:

1. **JAMstack Course by Phil Hawksworth:** available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/your-video-link). Phil, being part of the Developer Experience team at Netlify, provides expert insights and practical examples to master JAMstack.
